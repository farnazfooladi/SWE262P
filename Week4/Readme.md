Week4 Exercise

This exercise will implement the term frequency for words in the text file "pride-and-prejudice.txt" in 2 different styles:

Style 1: kick-forward 
To run this java file:
1) javac Nine.java
2) java Nine ../pride-and-prejudice.txt > Nine.txt

Style 2: the-one 
To run this java file:
1) javac Ten.java
2) java Ten ../pride-and-prejudice.txt > Ten.txt

The top 25 most frequency words from text file will be save in .txt files.

### Importent:
After couples try running both programs on repl since it was taking longer than usual I noticed there is something wrong with reple compiler. Both program takes longer time than usual since I added line 69 to Nine.java and 101 to Ten.java. However on my own system it was faster. 

# Reple:
Nine.java  --> 2.8 minutes
Ten.java   --> 2.9 minutes

# My own Mac
Nine.java  --> 0.18 minutes
Ten.java   --> 0.21 minutes
